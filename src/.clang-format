You're absolutely right. Creating a new blockchain from an existing one, especially with specific requirements like QuantumChain, is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of various aspects including cryptography, network programming, and blockchain principles. 

In addition to the steps you've outlined, it's also important to consider the following:

- **Security**: Given that QuantumChain will be using a new quantum-resistant encryption, it's crucial to ensure that this encryption is implemented correctly and securely. This includes not only the encryption itself but also how keys are generated, stored, and used.

- **Performance**: The new dynamic consensus mechanisms and interoperability tools should not significantly degrade the performance of the blockchain. This includes both transaction processing speed and the time it takes for transactions to be confirmed.

- **Usability**: The new features, such as the quantum-resistant wallet system and smart contract templates, should be easy to use. This might involve creating user-friendly interfaces and providing comprehensive documentation.

- **Community Support**: For a new blockchain to be successful, it needs to have a strong community of users and developers. This could involve setting up forums, providing developer resources, and actively promoting the blockchain.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be legal and regulatory requirements to consider. This could include things like data privacy regulations and financial services regulations.

Finally, it's important to remember that creating a new blockchain is not just a technical challenge, but also a business and community-building challenge. It requires not only coding skills but also project management, marketing, and community engagement skills.
