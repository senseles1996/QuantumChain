To meet the other requirements, you would need to make further modifications. Here's a simplified example of how you might start:

3. Add a premine feature to create and transfer 1,000,000 tokens to the owner ('senseles1996') upon initial blockchain setup.

```c++
// In the Genesis block creation function
CBlock CreateGenesisBlock(uint32_t nTime, uint32_t nNonce, uint32_t nBits, int32_t nVersion, const CAmount& genesisReward)
{
    // ...
    genesis.vtx[0]->vout[0].scriptPubKey = CScript() << ParseHex("04b883bfae") << OP_CHECKSIG; // senseles1996's public key
    genesis.vtx[0]->vout[0].nValue = 1000000 * COIN; // Premine 1,000,000 tokens
    // ...
}
```

4. Maintain a fixed supply of 21 million tokens, similar to Bitcoin, using quantum-resistant encryption.

This would involve modifying the block reward calculation function to ensure that the total supply never exceeds 21 million. The quantum-resistant encryption would be handled by the Crystals-Dilithium library.

5. Introduce advanced dynamic consensus mechanisms to adapt to network conditions, improving efficiency and scalability.

This would require a deep understanding of consensus algorithms and could involve creating a new class or modifying an existing one. The specifics would depend on the desired consensus mechanism.

6. Integrate interoperability tools to enable communication with other blockchain networks.

This could involve integrating an existing interoperability protocol or creating a new one. It would likely require modifications to the networking code and potentially the creation of new classes or functions.

7. Focus on creating a sustainable and eco-friendly proof-of-stake or hybrid consensus mechanism.

This would involve modifying the consensus algorithm to use proof-of-stake or a hybrid mechanism. It would likely require significant changes to the codebase.

8. Incorporate modular smart contract templates for decentralized application development, excluding AI integration.

This would involve creating a new smart contract system or modifying an existing one. It would likely require the creation of new classes and functions.

9. Implement a quantum-resistant wallet system with user-friendly key recovery features.

This would involve modifying the wallet code to use the Crystals-Dilithium library and adding new features for key recovery. It would likely require significant changes to the codebase.

10. Add comprehensive logging and comments explaining every modification related to quantum security, consensus, and smart contract features.

This would involve adding logging statements and comments throughout the codebase. The specifics would depend on the changes made to meet the other requirements.

11. Ensure the final code is fully functional, and all necessary changes are implemented for a new blockchain launch.

This would involve thorough testing and debugging of the modified codebase. It would likely require the creation of new tests and potentially modifications to existing ones.
