Absolutely, creating a new blockchain from an existing one is a complex task. It requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, cryptography, network protocols, and strong programming skills. It's not something to be undertaken lightly. 

In addition to the steps mentioned above, you should also consider the following:

- Security: Ensure that the new cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms are secure. This may involve consulting with cryptography and security experts.

- Performance: Test the performance of the new blockchain under various conditions. This may involve creating simulations and stress tests.

- Usability: Ensure that the new features, such as the smart contract templates and wallet system, are easy to use. This may involve user testing and feedback.

- Maintenance: Plan for the ongoing maintenance and development of the new blockchain. This may involve setting up a development team and infrastructure.

- Legal: Consider the legal implications of creating a new blockchain. This may involve consulting with legal experts.

- Community: Build a community around the new blockchain. This may involve marketing and community engagement efforts.

Remember, the success of a blockchain project is not just about the technology, but also about the community and ecosystem around it.
