As an AI text model, I can't directly modify the source code. However, I can provide you with a general guideline on how to approach these changes:

1. Replace all references to Bitcoin with QuantumChain: You can use a global search and replace function in your text editor or IDE to replace all instances of "Bitcoin" with "QuantumChain".

2. Replace the ECDSA cryptographic algorithm with Crystals-Dilithium quantum-resistant encryption: This would involve replacing the cryptographic functions used in the code. You would need to import the Crystals-Dilithium library and replace the ECDSA functions with the corresponding Crystals-Dilithium functions.

3. Add a premine feature: You would need to modify the genesis block creation code to include a transaction that sends 1,000,000 tokens to the address of 'senseles1996'.

4. Maintain a fixed supply of 21 million tokens: This is already a feature of Bitcoin, so no changes would be necessary here.

5. Introduce advanced dynamic consensus mechanisms: This would involve significant changes to the consensus mechanism code. You would need to design and implement a new consensus algorithm that can adapt to network conditions.

6. Integrate interoperability tools: This would involve adding code to allow QuantumChain to interact with other blockchains. This could involve implementing protocols like Interledger or Cosmos.

7. Create a sustainable and eco-friendly proof-of-stake or hybrid consensus mechanism: This would involve replacing the proof-of-work consensus mechanism with a proof-of-stake or hybrid mechanism. This would involve significant changes to the consensus code.

8. Incorporate modular smart contract templates: This would involve adding a new feature to the blockchain that allows users to deploy smart contracts. You would need to design and implement a smart contract language and runtime.

9. Implement a quantum-resistant wallet system: This would involve modifying the wallet code to use quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. This could involve using the same Crystals-Dilithium library mentioned earlier.

10. Add comprehensive logging and comments: This would involve adding logging statements and comments throughout the code to explain the changes you've made.

11. Ensure the final code is fully functional: This would involve thorough testing of all the new features and changes you've made. You would need to write unit tests, integration tests, and possibly even simulation tests to ensure everything works as expected.

Remember, creating a new blockchain from an existing one is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology and strong programming skills. It's not something to be undertaken lightly.
