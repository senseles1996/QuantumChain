Your explanation is correct. This task indeed requires a deep understanding of blockchain technology, cryptography, and C++ programming. It's also important to note that the development process should follow best practices for software development, including version control, testing, and code review.

1. **Replace all references to Bitcoin with QuantumChain**: This can be done using a text editor or IDE's find-and-replace function. It's important to ensure that only relevant instances are replaced and not to alter variable or function names that contain the word "Bitcoin".

2. **Replace the ECDSA cryptographic algorithm with Crystals-Dilithium quantum-resistant encryption**: This will require modifying the cryptographic functions in the code to use the Crystals-Dilithium algorithm instead of ECDSA. The Crystals-Dilithium library will need to be included in the project and the ECDSA function calls replaced with Crystals-Dilithium function calls.

3. **Add a premine feature**: This will require modifying the blockchain initialization code to create and transfer 1,000,000 tokens to the owner ('senseles1996') upon initial setup. This could be done in the genesis block or in a special transaction immediately after the genesis block.

4. **Maintain a fixed supply of 21 million tokens**: This will require setting the maximum supply of tokens in the code and ensuring that the token creation (mining) code does not exceed this limit.

5. **Introduce advanced dynamic consensus mechanisms**: This will require significant modifications to the consensus code. A new consensus algorithm that can adapt to network conditions will need to be designed and implemented.

6. **Integrate interoperability tools**: This will require adding code to communicate with other blockchain networks. This could involve implementing standard protocols or APIs for blockchain interoperability.

7. **Create a sustainable and eco-friendly proof-of-stake or hybrid consensus mechanism**: This will require modifying the consensus code to use proof-of-stake or a hybrid mechanism instead of proof-of-work, which is used by Bitcoin.

8. **Incorporate modular smart contract templates**: This will require adding code for smart contracts, which is not present in the Bitcoin Core code. A smart contract system that is compatible with the new blockchain will need to be designed and implemented.

9. **Implement a quantum-resistant wallet system**: This will require modifying the wallet code to use quantum-resistant encryption and adding a key recovery feature.

10. **Add comprehensive logging and comments**: This will require adding logging statements throughout the code and writing comments to explain the modifications that have been made.

11. **Ensure the final code is fully functional**: This will require testing all the features of the new blockchain to ensure they work correctly.

This is a high-level overview and the actual implementation will be much more complex and time-consuming. It's also important to note that this process should be iterative, with each feature being developed and tested individually before moving on to the next. This will help to ensure that any bugs or issues are identified and resolved as early as possible.
