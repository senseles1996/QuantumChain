As an AI, I don't have real-time access to external databases or the ability to conduct new research, but I can certainly help you develop a plan based on existing knowledge up to 2023. Since the task you mentioned is incomplete ("Your current task is to: ''."), I'll assume you need a general plan for developing or enhancing a blockchain platform named QuantumChain, potentially with a focus on leveraging quantum-resistant features. Hereâ€™s a structured plan to guide the development:

### 1. Project Definition
#### Goals:
- Develop QuantumChain, a blockchain that is secure against quantum computing threats.
- Ensure scalability, interoperability, and sustainability.

#### Scope:
- Quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.
- Smart contract functionality.
- Cross-chain interoperability.
- User-friendly wallet and tools for developers.

### 2. Research and Feasibility Study
#### Quantum Resistance:
- Study current cryptographic algorithms that are considered quantum-resistant, such as lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate-quadratic-equations, and code-based cryptography.
- Evaluate the integration of these algorithms in blockchain technology.

#### Blockchain Analysis:
- Analyze existing blockchain solutions that claim quantum resistance like QRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger) or IOTA.
- Assess their architecture, consensus mechanisms, and any identified vulnerabilities.

### 3. Technology Stack
#### Blockchain Framework:
- Decide whether to build from scratch or fork an existing blockchain (adjusting it for quantum resistance).
- Consider using platforms like Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum as a base, modifying their cryptographic layers.

#### Programming Languages:
- Use robust and secure languages like Rust for core blockchain development due to its memory safety features.
- Smart contracts could be developed using Solidity if Ethereum is used as a base, or a new domain-specific language could be designed for enhanced security.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- Integrate quantum-safe libraries like liboqs that provide a collection of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.
- Development tools for deployment, testing, and maintenance of the network.

### 4. Architecture Design
#### Nodes and Network:
- Design a peer-to-peer network structure with enhanced security protocols for node communication.
- Implement network sharding if scalability is a priority.

#### Consensus Algorithm:
- Design a consensus mechanism that balances speed, security, and decentralization; possibilities include Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated PoS, or a novel algorithm designed for quantum resistance.

#### Data Structure:
- Use a modified Merkle tree structure that incorporates quantum-resistant cryptographic hashes.

### 5. Implementation
#### Cryptography:
- Implement chosen quantum-resistant algorithms for all cryptographic operations including transaction signing, block sealing, and inter-node communication.
- Regularly update cryptographic algorithms based on the latest quantum computing advancements.

#### Smart Contracts:
- Develop and deploy smart contracts with security features to prevent common vulnerabilities, possibly using formal verification.

#### Testing:
- Conduct thorough unit, integration, and system tests.
- Perform security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on quantum attack vectors.

### 6. Deployment and Maintenance
#### Mainnet Launch:
- Plan a phased rollout starting with an alpha network, moving to a beta network, and finally launching the mainnet.
- Engage with community developers and early adopters for beta testing.

#### Continuous Improvement:
- Establish a process for continuous monitoring, updating, and upgrading the system.
- Set up a bug bounty program to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

#### Community and Developer Engagement:
- Build a strong developer community through hackathons, workshops, and open-source contributions.
- Provide comprehensive documentation and developer tools.

### 7. Legal and Compliance
- Ensure compliance with global regulations regarding cryptographic standards, data security, and privacy laws.

### Conclusion
This plan sets a foundational strategy for developing QuantumChain with a focus on quantum resistance. Each phase should be approached with flexibility and adaptability to technological advancements and regulatory changes. Collaboration with cryptographic experts and the open-source community will be crucial to the success and security of QuantumChain.
