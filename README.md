What is Bitcoin Core?
---------------------

Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully
validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user
interface, which can be optionally built.

Further information about Bitcoin Core is available in the [doc folder](/doc).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository is used exclusively for the
development of the GUI. Its master branch is identical in all monotree
repositories. Release branches and tags do not exist, so please do not fork
that repository unless it is for development reasons.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled during the generation of the build system) with: `ctest`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `build/test/functional/test_runner.py`
(assuming `build` is your build directory).

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

## Progress Update

### Task: 2. **Scalability Solutions:**
To address the scalability issues in QuantumChain, we need to consider both on-chain and off-chain solutions. Scalability is a critical factor for the success of any blockchain system, especially for those like QuantumChain that might be handling a large number of transactions. Below, I outline a comprehensive plan that includes both technical strategies and code changes where applicable.

### 1. **Sharding**

**Overview:**
Sharding is a method that divides the blockchain into several smaller partitions, known as shards, each capable of processing transactions independently. This can significantly increase the network's overall throughput.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Define Shard Structure:** Partition the QuantumChain network into multiple shards, each responsible for a subset of transactions and maintaining a portion of the state.
2. **Shard Management:** Implement a protocol to manage shards, including mechanisms for creating new shards and adjusting the shard size based on the network load.
3. **Inter-shard Communication:** Develop a robust protocol for communication between shards to handle transactions that span multiple shards.

**Code Snippet Example:**
```python
class Shard:
    def __init__(self, id, nodes):
        self.id = id
        self.nodes = nodes  # Nodes assigned to this shard
        self.transactions = []  # Transactions specific to this shard

    def process_transaction(self, transaction):
        # Logic to process transactions within this shard
        pass

    def communicate(self, other_shard, data):
        # Logic for inter-shard communication
        pass
```

### 2. **Layer 2 Scaling Solutions (State Channels, Sidechains)**

**Overview:**
Layer 2 solutions involve processing transactions off the main blockchain (off-chain) to reduce the load on the main chain.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **State Channels:** Implement state channels that allow multiple transactions to occur between participants off the main chain, with only two transaction records on-chain – one to open the channel and one to close it.
2. **Sidechains:** Develop sidechains that are connected to the main QuantumChain but operate independently. Transactions can be processed on these sidechains and then reconciled with the main chain periodically.

**Code Snippet Example:**
```python
class StateChannel:
    def __init__(self, participants):
        self.participants = participants
        self.balance = dict((participant, 0) for participant in participants)

    def update(self, participant, amount):
        # Update balances off-chain
        self.balance[participant] += amount

    def close_channel(self):
        # Logic to settle final state on-chain
        pass
```

### 3. **Optimized Consensus Mechanism**

**Overview:**
Improving the efficiency of the consensus mechanism can greatly enhance transaction throughput.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Consensus Algorithm:** Evaluate and possibly replace the current consensus algorithm with a more efficient one like Proof of Stake (PoS) or a hybrid model.
2. **Block Propagation Enhancements:** Implement techniques such as block compression or propagation of block headers only to reduce latency.

**Code Snippet Example:**
```python
def validate_transaction(transaction, current_state):
    # Validation logic for transactions under new consensus rules
    pass

def create_block(transactions):
    # Block creation logic optimized for faster propagation
    pass
```

### 4. **Network Enhancements**

**Overview:**
Improving the underlying network can help in faster data propagation and reduced latency.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Gossip Protocol Enhancements:** Optimize data propagation methods to ensure quick and reliable data distribution across the network.
2. **Peer Management:** Implement adaptive peer management strategies to optimize the connection and data flow between nodes.

**Code Snippet Example:**
```python
def propagate_data(data, peers):
    # Enhanced gossip protocol logic
    for peer in peers:
        send_data(peer, data)

def send_data(peer, data):
    # Send data to peer
    pass
```

### Conclusion

Implementing these scalability solutions for QuantumChain involves a combination of architectural changes and specific code implementations. Each component—from sharding and Layer 2 solutions to consensus optimization and network enhancements—plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall scalability of the system. Regular review and iterative improvements based on network performance data will be essential to refine these solutions further.

## Progress Update

### Task: Implement the consensus mechanism based on research and examples from other blockchains.
To implement a consensus mechanism for QuantumChain, we first need to decide on the type of consensus mechanism that best suits the blockchain's requirements, such as scalability, security, and decentralization. For this example, let's consider implementing a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, which is commonly used in modern blockchains due to its energy efficiency compared to Proof of Work (PoW).

### Step 1: Define Requirements and Goals
- **Scalability**: The mechanism should support a large number of transactions.
- **Security**: It should be resistant to common attacks like the nothing-at-stake problem.
- **Decentralization**: Ensure that the power isn’t concentrated in the hands of a few.

### Step 2: Research and Inspiration
Look into existing PoS implementations such as:
- **Ethereum 2.0 (Beacon Chain)**: Ethereum's shift from PoW to PoS.
- **Cardano**: Uses Ouroboros, a peer-reviewed PoS protocol.
- **Tezos**: Features on-chain governance and a unique baking (staking) system.

### Step 3: Design the PoS Algorithm for QuantumChain
1. **Stake Locking**: Validators must lock a certain amount of tokens as stake.
2. **Validator Selection**: Use a random selection process, but weighted by the amount of stake and the duration for which it is locked.
3. **Consensus Formation**: Validators will create blocks when chosen and validate blocks when not. A block is finalized based on multi-round validation by different validators.
4. **Rewards and Penalties**: Implement rewards for block creation and validation. Penalties (slashing) for validators who act maliciously.

### Step 4: Implementing the PoS Mechanism
Here’s a high-level overview of the implementation using Python-like pseudocode:

```python
class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.current_transactions = []
        self.nodes = set()
        self.validators = {}  # Mapping of node_id to stake amount

    def register_node(self, address, stake):
        """
        Add a new node with a specific stake.
        """
        self.nodes.add(address)
        self.validators[address] = stake

    def valid_chain(self, chain):
        """
        Determine if a given blockchain is valid.
        """
        # Implement validation logic (check hashes, signatures, etc.)

    def resolve_conflicts(self):
        """
        Consensus Algorithm to resolve conflicts between nodes' chains.
        """
        # Longest valid chain rule or a chain with the highest cumulative stake validation.

    def new_block(self, proof, previous_hash):
        """
        Create a new Block in the Blockchain
        """
        block = {
            'index': len(self.chain) + 1,
            'timestamp': time(),
            'transactions': self.current_transactions,
            'proof': proof,
            'previous_hash': previous_hash or self.hash(self.chain[-1]),
        }
        self.current_transactions = []
        self.chain.append(block)
        return block

    def proof_of_stake(self):
        """
        Simple PoS consensus algorithm
        """
        last_block = self.last_block
        last_proof = last_block['proof']
        proof = 0
        while self.valid_proof(last_proof, proof, self.validators) is False:
            proof += 1
        return proof

    @staticmethod
    def valid_proof(last_proof, proof, validators):
        """
        Validate the proof: Does hash(last_proof, proof) contain 4 leading zeroes?
        """
        guess = f'{last_proof}{proof}'.encode()
        guess_hash = hashlib.sha256(guess).hexdigest()
        # More complex validation based on stake
        return guess_hash[:4] == "0000"

    def last_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]

# Example usage
blockchain = Blockchain()
blockchain.register_node('node_1_address', 1000)  # Node with 1000 tokens stake
blockchain.new_transaction(sender="A", recipient="B", amount=1)
proof = blockchain.proof_of_stake()
previous_hash = blockchain.hash(blockchain.last_block())
blockchain.new_block(proof, previous_hash)
```

### Step 5: Testing and Deployment
- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for each function, especially the consensus-related methods.
- **Testnet**: Deploy the blockchain on a test network to observe its behavior under real conditions.
- **Mainnet Launch**: After successful testing and potential audits, launch on the main network.

### Step 6: Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Monitoring Tools**: Implement tools to monitor the health and performance of the blockchain.
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the network with improvements and security patches.

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing a PoS consensus mechanism in QuantumChain, focusing on scalability, security, and decentralization.

## Progress Update

### Task: Add networking capabilities for peer-to-peer communication.
To add networking capabilities for peer-to-peer communication in QuantumChain, we need to establish a robust and secure method for nodes to communicate with each other. This involves setting up a network layer that can handle message passing, node discovery, and data synchronization across the blockchain network. Below is a detailed plan to implement these features, including some pseudo-code and architecture suggestions.

### 1. Define Network Protocol

First, decide on the network protocol to use. For blockchain applications, TCP/IP is commonly used due to its reliability. We will use TCP for establishing connections and transmitting data between peers.

### 2. Peer Discovery

Nodes need to discover each other to form a network. We can implement a peer discovery mechanism using one of the following methods:

- **Static List**: Start with a predefined list of node addresses. This is simple but not flexible.
- **DNS Seeding**: Use DNS to find the IP addresses of initial nodes.
- **Peer Exchange (PEX)**: Allow nodes to exchange information about other nodes in the network, helping the network to grow and stay resilient.

### 3. Establishing Connections

Once peers are discovered, nodes should establish connections. This involves:

- Listening for incoming connections.
- Attempting to connect to other nodes' known addresses.

### 4. Message Format

Define a protocol for the messages exchanged between nodes. This typically includes:

- **Versioning**: To ensure compatibility between different node versions.
- **Command**: Indicates the action or request type (e.g., `getBlock`, `postTransaction`).
- **Payload**: Contains the data for the command.
- **Checksum**: To verify data integrity.

### 5. Handling Connections and Messages

Implement handlers for various types of messages:

- **Block propagation**: When a new block is created, it should be sent to all peers.
- **Transaction propagation**: New transactions are also shared with all peers.
- **Consensus messages**: For consensus-related communication.

### 6. Data Synchronization

Implement mechanisms to keep the blockchain data synchronized across all nodes:

- **Blockchain length check**: On connection, nodes should compare blockchain lengths and sync if necessary.
- **Block request**: Nodes can request specific blocks they are missing.

### 7. Security Considerations

- Implement encryption (e.g., TLS) to secure data transmission.
- Use authentication mechanisms to verify node identities.
- Rate limiting and other measures to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

### Example Code Structure

Here’s a basic structure in Python using the `socket` library for TCP connections:

```python
import socket
import threading

def handle_client(conn, addr):
    print(f"Connected by {addr}")
    while True:
        data = conn.recv(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        # Process incoming data

### Task: Implement quantum-resistant cryptography for wallet addresses.
To implement quantum-resistant cryptography for wallet addresses in QuantumChain, we need to adopt cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum computing attacks. Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the cryptographic algorithms currently used in blockchain technologies, such as ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) and RSA. Therefore, transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is essential to ensure the security of blockchain transactions in the era of quantum computing.

### Step 1: Selecting a Quantum-Resistant Algorithm

The first step is to choose a suitable quantum-resistant algorithm. Several candidates are being considered by the cryptographic community, including:

- **Lattice-based cryptography**: Such as NTRU or schemes based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem.
- **Hash-based signatures**: Such as the Lamport signatures or the more space-efficient Merkle signature scheme.
- **Code-based cryptography**: Such as the McEliece cryptosystem.
- **Multivariate quadratic equations**: Such as the Rainbow scheme.
- **Isogeny-based cryptography**: Such as Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE).

For this implementation, we will use **Lattice-based cryptography**, specifically a scheme based on LWE, due to its efficiency and the level of security it provides.

### Step 2: Integrating the New Cryptographic Scheme

#### A. Update the Wallet Address Generation

1. **Dependency Installation**: Include a library that supports LWE-based schemes. For example, using a library like `liboqs` which provides an open-source collection of quantum-resistant algorithms.

    ```bash
    pip install liboqs-python
    ```

2. **Generating Keys**:
    - Modify the wallet's key generation logic to use LWE-based key generation.
    - Ensure that the public key is suitable for use as a wallet address.

    ```python
    import oqs

    def generate_keys():
        kem = oqs.KeyEncapsulation('Kyber512')
        public_key, secret_key = kem.keypair()
        return public_key, secret_key
    ```

3. **Address Derivation**:
    - Derive the wallet address from the public key, possibly using a hashing function to shorten the key if necessary.

    ```python
    import hashlib

    def derive_address(public_key):
        address = hashlib.sha256(public_key).hexdigest()
        return address
    ```

#### B. Transaction Signature

- Replace the existing signature scheme with one that is quantum-resistant, using the same LWE-based approach or another compatible PQC method.

    ```python
    def sign_transaction(private_key, transaction):
        # Placeholder for PQC signature logic
        signature = "quantum_resistant_signature"
        return signature
    ```

### Step 3: Testing and Validation

- **Unit Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests for the new cryptographic functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration with the QuantumChain blockchain, ensuring that transactions are processed correctly with the new wallet addresses and signatures.
- **Security Audit**: Conduct a thorough security audit to identify any potential vulnerabilities introduced by the new cryptographic scheme.

### Step 4: Deployment

- **Gradual Rollout**: Begin with a testnet deployment to monitor the performance and stability of the new system.
- **Community Feedback**: Engage with the community to gather feedback and address any issues.
- **Mainnet Migration**: Once confident in the stability and security, migrate to the mainnet with options for users to transition to new quantum-resistant addresses.

### Step 5: Documentation and Education

- **Update Documentation**: Revise the developer and user documentation to reflect changes in wallet address generation and transaction signing.
- **Educational Resources**: Provide resources to help both users and developers understand the importance of quantum resistance and how to use the new system.

By following these steps, QuantumChain can secure its infrastructure against potential quantum computing threats, ensuring the longevity and security of its blockchain ecosystem.

## Progress Update

### Task: Optimize the blockchain performance and scalability.
To optimize the performance and scalability of QuantumChain, a hypothetical blockchain, we need to consider several factors including transaction processing speed, block size, consensus mechanism, network architecture, and data storage efficiency. Below is a structured plan that outlines the necessary steps and technologies that could be adapted to enhance QuantumChain.

### 1. Review Current System Architecture
- **Assessment of Current Performance**: Analyze the current metrics related to transaction throughput, block time, and scalability limits.
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Pinpoint areas where delays or inefficiencies occur, such as block propagation delays or slow transaction validation processes.

### Implementation Example: Sharding

Here’s a basic conceptual implementation plan for sharding:

```python
class Shard:
    def __init__(self, id, nodes):
        self.id = id
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.transactions = []
        self.blockchain = []

    def add_transaction(self, transaction):
        self.transactions.append(transaction)

    def process_transactions(self):
        # Process transactions parallelly in each shard
        block = self.create_block(self.transactions)
        self.blockchain.append(block)
        self.transactions = []

    def create_block(self, transactions):
        # Create a new block containing transactions
        block = Block(transactions)
        return block

# Example usage
shards = [Shard(id=i, nodes=select_nodes_for_shard(i)) for i in range(num_shards)]
for transaction in incoming_transactions:
    shard_id = hash(transaction.sender) % num_shards
    shards[shard_id].add_transaction(transaction)
```

This example outlines how transactions could be distributed among different shards, allowing for parallel processing. Each shard handles its transactions and maintains its own blockchain segment.

By implementing these strategies, QuantumChain can significantly improve its performance and scalability, ensuring it remains competitive and capable of handling future demands.

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Capped.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Pausable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol";

contract QuantumChainToken is ERC20, ERC20Capped, ERC20Pausable, AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

    constructor(uint256 initialSupply, uint256 cap)
        ERC20("QuantumChainToken", "QCT")
        ERC20Capped(cap)
    {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _setupRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);  // Premine initial supply
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender), "Caller is not a minter");
        _mint(to, amount);
    }

    function pause() public {
        require(hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender), "Caller is not an admin");
        _pause();
    }

    function unpause() public {
        require(hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender), "Caller is not an admin");
        _unpause();
    }

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
        override(ERC20, ERC20Capped, ERC20Pausable)
    {
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }
}

// Example of a vesting contract for a beneficiary
contract QuantumVesting is VestingWallet {
    constructor(address beneficiary, uint64 start, uint64 duration)
        VestingWallet(beneficiary, start, duration)
    {}
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy and Verify

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the `QuantumChainToken` and `QuantumVesting` contracts to the blockchain.
2. **Verification**: Verify the contract code on platforms like Etherscan for transparency.
3. **Initial Distribution**: Execute the mint function to distribute premined tokens according to the distribution plan.

### Step 4: Audit and Testing

1. **Smart Contract Audit**: Have the smart contracts audited by a reputable firm to ensure there are no security flaws.
2. **Testnet Testing**: Deploy the contracts on a testnet and simulate the entire distribution process to catch any potential issues.

### Step 5: Launch and Monitoring

1. **Mainnet Launch**: After successful testing and auditing, launch the contracts on the mainnet.
2. **Monitoring Tools**: Implement monitoring tools to track the vesting process and any other contract interactions.

### Conclusion

This plan and the accompanying code provide a robust framework for implementing a premine and distribution logic for QuantumChain. It is crucial to maintain transparency and security throughout the process to build trust with the community and stakeholders.
