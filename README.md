What is Bitcoin Core?
---------------------

Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully
validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user
interface, which can be optionally built.

Further information about Bitcoin Core is available in the [doc folder](/doc).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository is used exclusively for the
development of the GUI. Its master branch is identical in all monotree
repositories. Release branches and tags do not exist, so please do not fork
that repository unless it is for development reasons.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled during the generation of the build system) with: `ctest`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `build/test/functional/test_runner.py`
(assuming `build` is your build directory).

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.


Modified for QuantumChain: A quantum-resistant blockchain project.

## Progress Update

### Task:    - **Research and Development:** Continue to invest in research to develop and integrate quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. This is crucial to safeguard the blockchain against potential quantum computing threats.
To address the task of integrating quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms into QuantumChain, a blockchain platform, we need a structured approach that encompasses research, development, testing, and deployment. Below is a detailed plan to achieve this, including potential code changes and best practices in blockchain development.

### Step 1: Research Phase

#### 1.1 Identify Quantum-Resistant Algorithms
- **Symmetric Algorithms**: Increase key sizes to ensure resistance (e.g., AES-256).
- **Asymmetric Algorithms**: Focus on post-quantum cryptography (PQC) such as lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate-quadratic-equations, and code-based cryptography.
  - **Lattice-based**: NewHope, FrodoKEM
  - **Hash-based**: XMSS, SPHINCS
  - **Code-based**: McEliece
  - **Multivariate**: Rainbow

#### 1.2 Evaluate Current Blockchain Cryptography
- Analyze the current cryptographic algorithms used in QuantumChain.
- Assess the vulnerability of these algorithms against quantum attacks.

#### 1.3 Research Integration Challenges
- Compatibility with existing blockchain architecture.
- Performance implications (speed, transaction throughput, block size).
- Interoperability with other blockchains and legacy systems.

### Step 2: Development Phase

#### 2.1 Design Quantum-Resistant Features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Initially, integrate PQC algorithms alongside existing cryptographic methods to maintain interoperability.
- **Key Management**: Develop secure methods for key generation, distribution, storage, and revocation.

#### 2.2 Code Changes and Implementation
- **Implement PQC Algorithms**: Integrate libraries that support PQC, such as Open Quantum Safe.
- **Upgrade Protocol**: Modify the blockchain protocol to support new cryptographic standards.

```python
# Example: Integrating a PQC library
from openquantumsafe import liboqs

def init_crypto_system():
    # Initialize the quantum-safe cryptographic algorithm
    kem = liboqs.KEM('FrodoKEM-640-AES')
    public_key, secret_key = kem.keypair()
    return public_key, secret_key

def encrypt_data(public_key, data):
    # Encrypt data using the public key
    ciphertext = liboqs.KEM.encapsulate(public_key)
    return ciphertext

def decrypt_data(secret_key, ciphertext):
    # Decrypt data using the secret key
    plaintext = liboqs.KEM.decapsulate(secret_key, ciphertext)
    return plaintext
```

#### 2.3 Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Test each new cryptographic module independently.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the integration with the existing blockchain system.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the impact on transaction speed and system throughput.

### Step 3: Deployment Phase

#### 3.1 Rollout Strategy
- **Beta Testing**: Roll out the updated blockchain on a testnet involving real users.
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect and analyze user feedback to identify any issues or potential improvements.

#### 3.2 Full Deployment
- **Gradual Rollout**: Gradually phase out old cryptographic standards and switch to quantum-resistant methods.
- **Monitoring and Updates**: Continuously monitor the system for security threats and update cryptographic standards as needed.

### Step 4: Documentation and Training

#### 4.1 Documentation
- Update the developer and user documentation to reflect changes in the blockchainâ€™s cryptographic protocols.

#### 4.2 Training
- Provide training sessions for developers and users on the new quantum-resistant features and best practices.

### Step 5: Continuous Improvement

#### 5.1 Stay Updated with Quantum Computing Developments
- Keep abreast of the latest developments in quantum computing and cryptography to anticipate future threats.

#### 5.2 Ongoing Research
- Continuously invest in research to explore new quantum-resistant cryptographic methods and improve existing ones.

By following this structured plan, QuantumChain can effectively integrate quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms to safeguard against potential quantum computing threats, ensuring robust security and future-proofing the blockchain platform.
