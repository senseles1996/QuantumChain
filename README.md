What is Bitcoin Core?
---------------------

Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully
validate blocks and transactions. It also includes a wallet and graphical user
interface, which can be optionally built.

Further information about Bitcoin Core is available in the [doc folder](/doc).

License
-------

Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository is used exclusively for the
development of the GUI. Its master branch is identical in all monotree
repositories. Release branches and tags do not exist, so please do not fork
that repository unless it is for development reasons.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled during the generation of the build system) with: `ctest`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `build/test/functional/test_runner.py`
(assuming `build` is your build directory).

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.


Modified for QuantumChain: A quantum-resistant blockchain project.

## Progress Update

### Task:    - **Research and Development:** Continue to invest in research to develop and integrate quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. This is crucial to safeguard the blockchain against potential quantum computing threats.
To address the task of integrating quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms into QuantumChain, a blockchain platform, we need a structured approach that encompasses research, development, testing, and deployment.

```python
# Example: Integrating a PQC library
from openquantumsafe import liboqs

def init_crypto_system():
    # Initialize the quantum-safe cryptographic algorithm
    kem = liboqs.KEM('FrodoKEM-640-AES')
    public_key, secret_key = kem.keypair()
    return public_key, secret_key

def encrypt_data(public_key, data):
    # Encrypt data using the public key
    ciphertext = liboqs.KEM.encapsulate(public_key)
    return ciphertext

def decrypt_data(secret_key, ciphertext):
    # Decrypt data using the secret key
    plaintext = liboqs.KEM.decapsulate(secret_key, ciphertext)
    return plaintext
```

#### 2.3 Testing

## Progress Update

### Task:    - **Implementation:** Gradually replace existing cryptographic methods with quantum-resistant alternatives, ensuring backward compatibility and smooth transitions.
To implement quantum-resistant cryptographic methods in QuantumChain while ensuring backward compatibility and smooth transitions, we need a structured approach. This involves understanding the current cryptographic landscape, selecting appropriate quantum-resistant algorithms, and integrating these into the existing blockchain system in a phased manner. Below is a detailed plan to achieve this:

### Step 1: Assessment of Current Cryptographic Methods

1. **Identify Current Algorithms**: Document all cryptographic algorithms currently in use, including those for hashing, digital signatures, and key exchanges.
2. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Analyze the susceptibility of these algorithms to quantum attacks, particularly focusing on those based on factorization and discrete logarithms, such as RSA and ECC.

### Step 2: Selection of Quantum-Resistant Algorithms

1. **Research Quantum-Resistant Algorithms**: Identify potential candidates like lattice-based cryptography (e.g., NTRU), hash-based signatures (e.g., XMSS), multivariate polynomial cryptography, and code-based cryptography.
2. **Performance and Security Evaluation**: Evaluate these algorithms based on security level, key size, computational requirements, and compatibility with blockchain requirements.
3. **Community and Expert Consultation**: Engage with the cryptographic community and internal stakeholders to gather insights and feedback.

### Step 3: Integration Strategy

1. **Dual Algorithm Support**: Initially, integrate quantum-resistant algorithms alongside existing ones to maintain backward compatibility.
2. **Modular Cryptography Architecture**: Refactor the blockchain’s architecture to allow easy swapping of cryptographic modules.
3. **API Abstraction**: Develop high-level APIs that abstract the underlying cryptographic operations, thus decoupling application logic from specific cryptographic implementations.

### Step 4: Implementation

1. **Coding Guidelines**:
   - Use well-documented libraries and frameworks known for their robustness in quantum-resistant algorithms.
   - Adhere to secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities such as side-channel attacks.

2. **Implementation Phases**:
   - **Phase 1**: Implement quantum-resistant algorithms in non-critical components of the blockchain to test and refine them.
   - **Phase 2**: Gradually replace cryptographic methods in more critical areas, such as transaction signing and block validation.
   - **Phase 3**: Entirely phase out older cryptographic methods once the new system proves to be stable and secure.

3. **Testing and Auditing**:
   - Conduct thorough testing including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
   - Perform security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on the new cryptographic implementations.

### Step 5: Transition and Update

1. **Node Updates**: Roll out updates that support the new cryptography through a soft fork, ensuring all nodes in the network adopt the new algorithms gradually.
2. **Community Outreach and Documentation**: Provide clear documentation and upgrade guides for users. Engage with the community through forums, webinars, and workshops to educate them about the benefits and necessity of transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography.
3. **Monitoring and Feedback Loop**: After deployment, continuously monitor the network performance and security, and gather user feedback. Use this information to refine and optimize the implementation.

### Step 6: Long-term Maintenance and Scalability

1. **Scalability Considerations**: Ensure that the new cryptographic methods do not adversely affect the scalability of the blockchain. Optimize algorithms and implementations as needed.
2. **Future-Proofing**: Stay updated with advancements in quantum computing and cryptography to further evolve and adapt the blockchain’s cryptographic measures.

### Conclusion

This plan provides a structured approach to transitioning QuantumChain to quantum-resistant cryptography. By carefully selecting appropriate algorithms, integrating them in a phased manner, and maintaining backward compatibility, QuantumChain can secure its infrastructure against quantum threats while minimizing disruption to its users.
